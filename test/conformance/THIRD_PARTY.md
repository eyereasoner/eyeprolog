# Third-party conformance test provenance

## Logtalk Prolog conformance tests

Selected standard term, atom, character, collection, control, and conversion
cases under `iso/` are adapted from the `tests/prolog` backend Prolog conformance suite in
[Logtalk](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3). Each adapted file
identifies its upstream test names. The cases were rewritten for EyeProlog's
file-based query and exact-output harness and are therefore modified from the
upstream files.

Part 3 grammar cases are additionally adapted from Logtalk's
`tests/logtalk/methods/phrase_2_3/tests.lgt` and
`tests/logtalk/dcgs/tests.lgt` suites. Object and unit-test scaffolding was
removed, translator-only assertions were converted to executable grammar
behavior where possible, and expected list errors use the portable ISO
`type_error(list)` term.

## Scryer Prolog ISO conformity tests

Selected lexical, term, numeric, comment, and operator cases under `iso/` are
adapted from `tests-pl/iso-conformity-tests.pl` in
[Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog). Each adapted file
identifies the corresponding upstream test numbers. The cases were rewritten
for EyeProlog's file-based query and exact-output harness.

Additional operator-directive and control-construct error-condition cases
under `iso/` are adapted from Scryer's `tests-pl/invalid_decl*.pl` and
`tests-pl/issue831-call0.pl` regression fixtures. Each adapted file identifies
its upstream source file.

## Trealla Prolog core tests

Selected standard-core cases under `iso/` are adapted from the numbered tests
in [`tests/tests`](https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla/tree/main/tests/tests)
and [`tests/issues`](https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla/tree/main/tests/issues)
in Trealla Prolog. Each adapted file identifies its upstream test file. The
cases were rewritten for EyeProlog's query and exact-output harness.

## SWI-Prolog core tests

Selected standard-core operator and finite-tree unification cases under `iso/`
are adapted from `tests/core/test_op.pl` and
`tests/core/test_occurs_check.pl` in
[SWI-Prolog](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel). Each adapted file
identifies its upstream source. The cases were rewritten for EyeProlog's query and
